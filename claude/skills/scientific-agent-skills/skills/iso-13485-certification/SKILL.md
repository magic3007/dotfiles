#### Creating Procedures (SOPs)

**General approach for all procedures:**

1. **Understand the requirement:**
   - Read relevant clause in `references/iso-13485-requirements.md`
   - Understand WHAT must be documented
   - Identify WHO, WHEN, WHERE for your organization

2. **Use template structure:**
   - Follow CAPA or Document Control templates as examples
   - Standard sections: Purpose, Scope, Definitions, Responsibilities, Procedure, Records, References
   - Keep procedures clear and actionable

3. **Define responsibilities clearly:**
   - Identify specific roles (not names)
   - Define responsibilities for each role
   - Ensure coverage of all required activities

4. **Document the "what" not excessive "how":**
   - Procedures should define WHAT must be done
   - Detailed HOW-TO goes in Work Instructions (Tier 3)
   - Strike balance between guidance and flexibility

5. **Include required elements:**
   - All elements specified in ISO 13485 clause
   - Records that must be maintained
   - Responsibilities for each activity
   - References to related documents

**Example: Creating CAPA Procedure**

1. Read ISO 13485 Clauses 8.5.2 and 8.5.3 from references
2. Use `assets/templates/procedures/CAPA-procedure-template.md`
3. Customize:
   - CAPA prioritization criteria for your organization
   - Root cause analysis methods you'll use
   - Approval authorities and responsibilities
   - Timeframes based on your operations
   - Integration with complaint handling, audits, etc.
4. Add forms as attachments:
   - CAPA Request Form
   - Root Cause Analysis Worksheet
   - Action Plan Template
   - Effectiveness Verification Checklist

#### Creating Medical Device Files (MDF)

**What is an MDF:**
- File for each medical device type or family

7. Installation requirements (if applicable)
8. Risk management file(s)
9. Verification and validation information
10. Design and development file(s) (when applicable)

**Process:**

1. Identify each device type or family
2. Create MDF structure (folder or binder)
3. Collect or create each required element
4. Ensure traceability between documents
5. Maintain as living document (update with changes)

### 5. Conduct Comprehensive Gap Analysis

**When to use:** User wants detailed assessment of all requirements

**Process:**

1. **Use comprehensive checklist:**
   - Open `references/gap-analysis-checklist.md`
   - Work through clause by clause
   - Mark status for each requirement: Compliant, Partial, Non-compliant, N/A

2. **For each clause:**
   - Read requirement description

5. **Final preparation:**
   - Brief management and staff
   - Prepare audit schedule
   - Organize evidence and records
   - Designate escorts and support personnel

## Best Practices

### Document Development

1. **Start at policy level, then add detail:**
   - Quality Manual = policy level
   - Procedures = what, who, when
   - Work Instructions = detailed how-to
   - Forms = data collection

2. **Maintain consistency:**
   - Use same terminology throughout
   - Cross-reference related documents
   - Keep numbering scheme consistent
   - Update all related documents together

3. **Write for your audience:**
   - Clear, simple language
   - Avoid jargon
   - Define technical terms
   - Provide examples where helpful

4. **Make procedures usable:**
   - Action-oriented language
   - Logical flow
   - Clear responsibilities
   - Realistic timeframes

### Exclusions

**When you can exclude:**
- Design and development (if contract manufacturer only)
- Installation (if product requires no installation)
- Servicing (if not offered)
- Sterilization (if non-sterile product)

**Justification requirements:**
- Must be in Quality Manual
- Must explain why excluded
- Cannot exclude if process performed
- Cannot affect ability to provide safe, effective devices

**Example good justification:**
> "Clause 7.3 Design and Development is excluded. ABC Company operates as a contract manufacturer and produces medical devices according to complete design specifications provided by customers. All design activities are performed by the customer and ABC Company has no responsibility for design inputs, outputs, verification, validation, or design changes."

**Example poor justification:**
> "We don't do design." (Too brief, doesn't explain why or demonstrate no impact)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Copying ISO 13485 text verbatim**
   - Write in your own words
   - Describe YOUR processes
   - Make it actionable for your organization

2. **Making procedures too detailed**
   - Procedures should be stable
   - Excessive detail belongs in work instructions
   - Balance guidance with flexibility

3. **Creating documents in isolation**
   - Ensure consistency across QMS
   - Cross-reference related documents
   - Build on previously created documents

4. **Forgetting records**
   - Every procedure should specify records
   - Define retention requirements
   - Ensure records actually maintained

5. **Inadequate approval**
   - Quality Manual must be signed by top management
   - All procedures must be properly approved
   - Train staff before documents become effective
