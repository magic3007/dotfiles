## Getting Started

### Step 1: Authentication Setup

Before using any protocols.io API functionality:

1. Obtain an access token (CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN or OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN)
2. Read `references/authentication.md` for detailed authentication procedures
3. Store the token securely
4. Include in all requests as: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

### Step 2: Identify Your Use Case

Determine which capability area addresses your needs:

- **Working with protocols?** → Read `references/protocols_api.md`
- **Managing team protocols?** → Read `references/workspaces.md`
- **Handling comments/feedback?** → Read `references/discussions.md`
- **Uploading files/data?** → Read `references/file_manager.md`
- **Tracking experiments or profiles?** → Read `references/additional_features.md`

### Step 3: Implement Integration

Follow the guidance in the relevant reference files:

- Each reference includes detailed endpoint documentation
- API parameters and request/response formats are specified
- Common use cases and workflows are provided with examples
- Best practices and error handling guidance included

## Base URL and Request Format

All API requests use the base URL:
```
https://protocols.io/api/v3
```

All requests require the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Most endpoints support JSON request/response format with `Content-Type: application/json`.

## Content Format Options

Many endpoints support a `content_format` parameter to control how protocol content is returned:

- `json`: Draft.js JSON format (default)
- `html`: HTML format
- `markdown`: Markdown format

Include as query parameter: `?content_format=html`

## Rate Limiting

Be aware of API rate limits:

- **Standard endpoints**: 100 requests per minute per user
- **PDF endpoint**: 5 requests/minute (signed-in), 3 requests/minute (unsigned)

Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors (HTTP 429).

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Import and Analyze Protocol

To analyze an existing protocol from protocols.io:

1. **Search**: Use `GET /protocols` with keywords to find relevant protocols
2. **Retrieve**: Get full details with `GET /protocols/{protocol_id}`
3. **Extract**: Parse steps, materials, and metadata for analysis
4. **Review discussions**: Check `GET /protocols/{id}/comments` for user feedback
5. **Export**: Generate PDF if needed for offline reference

**Reference files**: `protocols_api.md`, `discussions.md`

### Workflow 2: Create and Publish Protocol

To create a new protocol and publish with DOI:

1. **Authenticate**: Ensure you have valid access token (see `authentication.md`)
2. **Create**: Use `POST /protocols` with title and description
3. **Add steps**: For each step, use `POST /protocols/{id}/steps`
4. **Add materials**: Document reagents in step components
5. **Review**: Verify all content is complete and accurate
6. **Publish**: Issue DOI with `POST /protocols/{id}/publish`

**Reference files**: `protocols_api.md`, `authentication.md`

### Workflow 3: Collaborative Lab Workspace

To set up team protocol management:

1. **Create/join workspace**: Access or request workspace membership (see `workspaces.md`)

## Python Request Examples

### Basic Protocol Search

```python
import requests

token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}

# Search for CRISPR protocols
response = requests.get(
    "https://protocols.io/api/v3/protocols",
    headers=headers,
    params={
        "filter": "public",
        "key": "CRISPR",
        "page_size": 10,
        "content_format": "html"
    }
)

protocols = response.json()
for protocol in protocols["items"]:
    print(f"{protocol['title']} - {protocol['doi']}")
```

### Create New Protocol

```python
import requests

token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Create protocol
data = {
    "title": "CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing Protocol",
    "description": "Comprehensive protocol for CRISPR gene editing",
    "tags": ["CRISPR", "gene editing", "molecular biology"]
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://protocols.io/api/v3/protocols",
    headers=headers,
    json=data
)

protocol_id = response.json()["item"]["id"]
print(f"Created protocol: {protocol_id}")
```

### Upload File to Workspace

```python
import requests

token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}

# Upload file
with open("data.csv", "rb") as f:
    files = {"file": f}
    data = {
        "folder_id": "root",
        "description": "Experimental results",
        "tags": "experiment,data,2025"
    }

    response = requests.post(
        "https://protocols.io/api/v3/workspaces/12345/files/upload",
        headers=headers,
        files=files,
        data=data
    )

file_id = response.json()["item"]["id"]
print(f"Uploaded file: {file_id}")
```

## Error Handling

Implement robust error handling for API requests:

```python
import requests
import time

def make_request_with_retry(url, headers, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

            if response.status_code == 200:
                return response.json()
            elif response.status_code == 429:  # Rate limit
                retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', 60))
                time.sleep(retry_after)
                continue
            elif response.status_code >= 500:  # Server error
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
                continue
            else:
                response.raise_for_status()

        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```
