# Ginkgo Cloud Lab

## Overview

Ginkgo Cloud Lab (https://cloud.ginkgo.bio) provides remote access to Ginkgo Bioworks' autonomous lab infrastructure. Protocols are executed on Reconfigurable Automation Carts (RACs) -- modular units with robotic arms, maglev sample transport, and industrial-grade software spanning 70+ instruments.

The platform also includes **EstiMate**, an AI agent that accepts human-language protocol descriptions and returns feasibility assessments and pricing for custom workflows beyond the listed protocols.

## Available Protocols

### 1. Cell Free Protein Expression Validation

Rapid go/no-go expression screening using reconstituted E. coli CFPS. Submit a FASTA sequence (up to 1800 bp) and receive expression confirmation, baseline titer (mg/L), and initial purity with virtual gel images.

- **Price:** $39/sample | **Turnaround:** 5-10 days | **Status:** Certified
- **Details:** See [references/cell-free-protein-expression-validation.md](references/cell-free-protein-expression-validation.md)

### 2. Cell Free Protein Expression Optimization

DoE-based optimization across up to 24 conditions per protein (lysates, temperatures, chaperones, disulfide enhancers, cofactors). Designed for difficult-to-express and membrane proteins.

- **Price:** $199/sample | **Turnaround:** 6-11 days | **Status:** Certified
- **Details:** See [references/cell-free-protein-expression-optimization.md](references/cell-free-protein-expression-optimization.md)

### 3. Fluorescent Pixel Art Generation

Transform a pixel art image (48x48 to 96x96 px, PNG/SVG) into fluorescent bacterial artwork using up to 11 E. coli strains via acoustic dispensing. Delivered as high-res UV photographs.

- **Price:** $25/plate | **Turnaround:** 5-7 days | **Status:** Beta
- **Details:** See [references/fluorescent-pixel-art-generation.md](references/fluorescent-pixel-art-generation.md)

## General Ordering Workflow

1. Select a protocol at https://cloud.ginkgo.bio/protocols
2. Configure parameters (number of samples/proteins, replicates, plates)
3. Upload input files (FASTA for protein protocols, PNG/SVG for pixel art)
4. Add any special requirements in the Additional Details field
5. Submit and receive a feasibility report and price quote

For protocols not listed above, use the **EstiMate** chat to describe a custom protocol in plain language and receive compatibility assessment and pricing.
