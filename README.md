# dotfiles
ðŸ¤— A collection of docker, gdb, git, vim, neovim, zsh, ranger, conda, pip, and tmux configuration files and setup script under various OS.

Dotfiles use [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for installation. After cloning this repo, run `install` to automatically set up the development environment. Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run multiple times.
